Changes in Version 1.17.4

   o Bug fixes to wtermp code and how it's called in wfindcpt.

Changes in Version 1.17.3

   o Weighted segmentation code added.  Weights per probe can be used.

Changes in Version 1.17.1

   o NAMESPACE file added and man pages fixed to reflect it.


1.15.4 became 1.16.0 in Bioconductor 2.3 & =1.17.0 now
------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.15.4

   o make sure there are at least 10 obsns when t-stat threshold is used

Changes in Version 1.15.3

   o the minimum width of segment is user selectable (argument min.width). 
     Changed from the fixed value of 2 based on user demand.  Max value 5.

Changes in Version 1.15.2

   o changed to a faster algorithm for calculating the max t-statistic

   o changed to a faster code for undoing edge effects (redundant perm)

   o added basic functions exon.segment and exon.changepoint (workhorse)
     These functions are used for finding a translocation using binary
     segmentation.  The data for this should be properly normalized.

   o fortran code re-arranged into different files

Changes in Version 1.15.1

   o updated the call to get(getOption("device")) to use dev.new


1.13.3 became 1.14.0 in Bioconductor 2.2 & =1.15.0 now
------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.13.3

   o Added segments.summary to give the median, sd & mad for each segment.

Changes in Version 1.13.2

   o Modified the p-value function to replace p > 1 with 1.

Changes in Version 1.13.1

   o Modified the p-value function.  Added pseudo confidence intervals 
     for the change-points.

   o Windowing option has been removed (R & fortran code modified).


1.11.2 became 1.12.0 in Bioconductor 2.1 & =1.13.0 now
------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.11.2

   o Added a p-value function for the change-points.  This is based on 
     binary segmentation and not necessarily correct but gives an idea
     of the relative importance of the change-points.

Changes in Version 1.11.1

   o Changed Venkat's affiliation from MSKCC to Columbia University


1.9.3 became 1.10.0 in Bioconductor 2.0 & =1.11.0 now
-----------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.9.3

   o Added warning that windowing will be deprecated in the next version.

Changes in Version 1.9.2

   o Added code to not bother with p-values and split the segment when the
     maximal T is large (p-value will be tiny if T > 7).

   o Added code to not split when the maximal T is small (fixes a numerical
     problem where a constant large segment can have a significant split).

Changes in Version 1.9.1

   o The mod function in fortran inflicts serious time penalty --
     code rewritten to fix it


1.5.3 became 1.6(8).0 in Bioconductor 1.8(9) & =1.9.0 now
---------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.5.3

   o Fixed the subset functions to enable sample re-ordering

Changes in Version 1.5.2

   o Bug fix in plot.DNAcopy (triggered only when #chrom=1)

   o Added information about stopping rule in the Vignette

   o Cytoband data from the goldenPath repository added for future plots

Changes in Version 1.5.1

   o Add a sequential stopping rule to declare change early 

   o Bug fix - make the object from subset.DNAcopy of class DNAcopy

1.2.5 became 1.4.0 in Bioconductor 1.7 & =1.5.0 in the development branch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.2.5

   o Updated the vignette to include references to additional features.

Changes in Version 1.2.4

   o Seg fault occurs if window.size is set when hybrid method is used.
     Fixed by setting window.size to be NULL in the function segment.

   o Added options to plot command to draw line at y=0 and control its 
     color and lwd of all lines.

   o If ylim is missing it's calculated from all the data instead of just
     the first sample.

Changes in Version 1.2.3

   o Modifications to the plot function to make par("ask") behave better.

Changes in Version 1.2.2

   o Modified the plot function.  X-axis is either the index or (cumulative) 
     map location. Incorporate col, pch, ylim etc. to provide better control
     over plots.

Changes in Version 1.2.1

   o Added the hybrid method for computing p-values to determine splits.  This
     speeds up the computations considerably and so has been made the default.
