Changes in Version 1.2.1

   o Added the hybrid method for computing p-values to determine splits.  This
     speeds up the computations considerably and so has been made the default.

Changes in Version 1.2.2

   o Modified the plot function.  X-axis is either the index or (cumulative) 
     map location. Incorporate col, pch, ylim etc. to provide better control
     over plots.

Changes in Version 1.2.3

   o Modifications to the plot function to make par("ask") behave better.
