The data format for the CNA object was changed in version 1.23.4
It is now an S4 object with slots chrom, maploc and genomdat
chrom and maploc are vectors and genomdat is a matrix or
a filebacked big.matrix from the package bigmemory.

Since DNAcopy object contains a CNA object it has also changed.
Convert any saved CNA/DNAcopy object using convertCNA/convertDNAcopy.
