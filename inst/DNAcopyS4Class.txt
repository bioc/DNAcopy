The data format for the CNA object was changed in version 1.23.4
It is now an S4 object with slots chrom, maploc and genomdat
chrom and maploc are vectors and genomdat is a matrix or
a filebacked big.matrix from the package bigmemory.

Since DNAcopy object contains a CNA object it has also changed.
Convert any saved CNA/DNAcopy object using convertCNA/convertDNAcopy.

LargeDataDNAcopy.pdf in the doc sub-directory for file based data guide.

CAUTION:  If xdat is a CNA object and xseg the output from segment then
the logratio for sample i cannot be accessed as xdat[["i+2"]] or 
xseg$data[["i+2"]].  xdat[,i+2] will work but will now give sample i+2 
and not sample i.  Both xdat[,i] & xseg[,i] give you the correct data.
